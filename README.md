# Tomato Leaf Disease Classification 🍅

## Overview  
This project implements a deep-learning based system for classifying diseases on tomato leaves.  
Given an image of a tomato leaf, the model predicts whether it is **healthy** or has a specific disease (e.g., early blight, bacterial spot, leaf mold, etc.).  

The goal is to assist with early diagnosis of tomato crop diseases and thereby improve yield and reduce losses.

## Features  
- Data loading & preprocessing of tomato leaf images  
- Training a convolutional neural network (CNN) for multi-class classification  
- Evaluation metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report)  
- (Optional) A prediction/inference script to classify new leaf images  
- Easily extendable to new disease classes or other crops

## Tech Stack  
- Python (3.x)  
- Jupyter Notebook or Python script  
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib / Seaborn, TensorFlow / Keras (or PyTorch)  
- Git / GitHub for version control  

## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
- Python 3.7 or later  
- `pip` or `conda` package manager  

### Installation  
1. Clone the repository
